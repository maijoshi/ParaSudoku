## Reader's Note

On Saturday, May 6th, we changed our project from ScanNet: Video Analysis on MXNet to ParaSudoku. We were facing several issues configuring, understanding, and defining our evaluation criteria for both MXNet and Scanner. Due to the time constraints that we were facing, we decided to refocus our efforts on parallelizing algorithms that we could code from scratch. The proposal and checkpoint for our previous project are located [here](https://sophie4869.github.io/ScanNet/).

## Summary

We implemented two sequential and three parallel sudoku solvers. We used a brute-force, backtracking algorithm and Crook's Algorithm to implement the two sequential sudoku solvers. We then parallelized the brute-force backtracking algorithm using Cuda and running multiple threads on the GPU. We parallelized Crook's Algorithm in two ways: 

## Background

Sudoku is traditionally played on a 9x9 board. These 81 cells on the board are broken down into 9 3x3 subboxes. The goal of the game is to play the numbers 1-9 in the cells such that no row, column, or box contains the same number twice.
